# Sample_app use Ruby on Rails

This is a sample app. I'm learning rails. [This tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/frontmatter) is awesome.

## License

I don't now how to set a license so...

Maybe MIT?

Ok license is MIT.

(What does that mean? Whatever.)

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
